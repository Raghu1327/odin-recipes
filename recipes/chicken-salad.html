    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I feel like pasta salads have been having a glow up 
        ever since we realized we don’t need to load them 
        with a pound of mayo. No shame in enjoying the nostalgic, 
        mayo-filled pasta salad, but wait until you try this
        incredible chicken bacon ranch pasta salad.</p>
    <p>After I originally shared an amazing BLT pasta salad 
        last summer I knew I wanted a new twist with 
        delicious grilled chicken and a rainbow of veggies.
        This wonderful pasta salad is mayo-free and filled 
        with grilled chicken, crispy bacon, your fav pasta, 
        all of the best summer produce and the easiest, creamy 
        ranch dressing. Everyone at your next BBQ is going to 
        fall in LOVE so be sure to put this one on your summer holiday menu!
