    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The first time I’d ever heart of watermelon salad 
        with feta was on the last season of The Next Food Network Star. 
        And I won’t lie, I thought it sounded pretty grim. But throughout 
        the last year, I’ve seen it popping up here and there in magazines, 
        cooking shows, and the blogosphere and I finally decided to get 
        up the guts to try it. And I’m so not regretting it.</p>
    <p>I remember being a kid when my dad would sprinkle salt on his 
        watermelon and I thought he was nuts until I tried it myself. 
        The same idea is in action here–the salty creaminess of the feta 
        complements the sweet crispness of the watermelon really nicely. 
        In fact, for all the reputation that feta has for being a strong flavor, 
        in this salad, the feta is probably the most subtle of all the flavors. 
        With the spiciness of the onions and basil and the sweetness of the mint 
        and watermelon, the gentle tangy-ness of the feta balances things out perfectly.
